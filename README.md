# Oxygen Not Included Seeds
Oxygen Not Included Seeds is a unofficial collection of seeds for the last ONI builds with web acess from https://zuxelus.github.io/ONISeeds/ where you can use filters to find needed Geysers and see their positions of the map.

I don't have Oxygen Not Included - Spaced Out! DLC so all seeds are for base game only.
